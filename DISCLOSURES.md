# Disclosures

This file covers privacy, credential storage, AI assistance, third-party software licenses, and security reporting for boxwatchr.

## Privacy and Data Handling

boxwatchr runs entirely on your own infrastructure. It connects to services you configure (your IMAP server) and services bundled inside the container (rspamd, Redis, Unbound). It has no connection to any server operated by sNyteXx.

- No analytics, telemetry, usage tracking, or error reporting of any kind is collected.
- sNyteXx has no visibility into who is running boxwatchr, how it is configured, or what email it processes.
- All data, including emails, processing logs, and configuration, stays on the host where the container runs.

The only connection boxwatchr initiates to a server outside your own infrastructure is a periodic check against the GitHub Releases API to detect whether a newer version is available. This request goes to GitHub's servers, not sNyteXx's, and is subject to [GitHub's Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement). No account data, email content, or identifying information is sent as part of this request. The version check can be disabled in the application config if you prefer boxwatchr to make no external connections beyond your own mail server.

## Credential Storage

All passwords stored by boxwatchr are protected at rest.

- IMAP passwords are encrypted using Fernet symmetric encryption (provided by the `cryptography` library) before being written to the SQLite database. They are never stored in plaintext.
- The web dashboard password is stored as a hash, never in plaintext.

The encryption key is derived from the host environment and never transmitted outside the container.

## AI Assistance

Claude Code has been consulted during the development of boxwatchr as a coding assistant, primarily for conventions, logic review, and implementation guidance on specific, narrowly scoped tasks. At no point has any AI tool been given free rein over the codebase. Every suggestion made by Claude Code was evaluated, decided on, and reviewed by a human before being accepted, and in most cases the resulting code was written or retyped by hand rather than applied directly.

All code published in this repository reflects deliberate human authorship and judgment. AI assistance was a tool, not a co-author.

## Security Vulnerabilities

To report a security vulnerability, please use [GitHub's private security advisory feature](https://github.com/sNyteXx/boxwatchr/security/advisories/new) rather than opening a public issue. This keeps the details private until a fix is available.
